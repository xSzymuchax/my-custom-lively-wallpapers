# Lively Wallpapers repo.

Every folder contains an independent wallpaper, that you can set as your desktop wallpaper.

Examples is a folder... with examples :D


# How to add wallpaper

Open lively and click '+' button, then select .zip file with wallpaper. (For some reason Lively doesn't recognize my zips so...)

All you need to do is:

1) Have Lively Wallpapers installed on your device.

2) Go to the program directory, which depending on your installation might vary:

    - C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Lively Wallpaper\Library

    - C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Packages\12030rocksdanister.LivelyWallpaper_97hta09mmv6hy\LocalCache\Local\Lively Wallpaper\Library\SaveData\wptmp

    You can also try adding it through the app, but it didn't work for me.

3) When in the directory, just copy the folder with wallpaper you want to set.

4) Now, Start lively wallpapers, or if it's already started, restart it to reload it's resources.

5) At this point, the wallpaper should be visible in the program, just click it to set it!

## Hollow Knight - Grimm Troupe Theme Menu

So, recently i was playing hollow knight, and this menu made a really good impression on me, so inspired by that... 

I made my version that is possible to set as wallpaper :p

## Love

This one allows you to put some photos of your loved ones on your screen. To do this, just add some photos into 

'PhotoHeartParticle/SamplePhotos'. Then, you need to write down filenames into 'photos.json', or use prepared script.

Script will do it for you, just start it. You need python installed. Example value for json is:

[
    "filename1",
    "filaname2"
]
